# Netflix Data Analysis & Dashboard

## Project Overview
This project analyzes Netflix shows and movies using a dataset of titles, genres, countries, release years, durations, and ratings. The goal is to explore and visualize Netflix’s content trends, providing insights into:

- Top countries producing content  
- Most popular genres  
- Movie durations  
- Content ratings distribution  

The project uses **Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn** for data cleaning, exploration, and visualization. A dashboard-style summary combines multiple analyses for a holistic view.


## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is publicly available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivamb/netflix-shows):

- File: `netflix_titles.csv`  
- Columns include: `title`, `type` (Movie/TV Show), `director`, `cast`, `country`, `date_added`, `release_year`, `rating`, `duration`, `listed_in` (genres), `description`

## Key Analyses

1. **Top 10 Countries Producing Netflix Content**
   - Shows which countries produce the most Netflix content.
2. **Top 10 Genres**
   - Most popular content categories.
3. **Movie Duration Distribution**
   - Understand how long Netflix movies typically are.
4. **Content Ratings**

These insights are combined into a **dashboard** using Matplotlib and Seaborn.
